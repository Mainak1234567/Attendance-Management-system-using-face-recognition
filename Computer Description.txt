Hardware Requirements:
1.	Processor: Intel i5 or higher for efficient processing.
2.	RAM: Minimum 8 GB to handle real-time recognition.
3.	Storage: 500 GB or more for storing the database and logs.
4.	Camera: High-resolution camera (720p or higher) for accurate face detection.
5.	Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): Optional for faster model inference (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1050 or higher).
Software Requirements:
1.	Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS.
2.	Programming Language: Python (for face detection and recognition modules).
3.	Libraries and Frameworks: OpenCV, Dlib, TensorFlow/PyTorch for model implementation.
4.	Database: SQLite, MySQL, or cloud-based solutions for data storage.
5.	Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or Visual Studio Code for coding and testing.
